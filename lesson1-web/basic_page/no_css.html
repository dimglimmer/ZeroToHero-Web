	Comments
	==========================================

	Comments are special tags in an HTML document that the browser ignores. 
	The browser literally notices the closing tag and ignores every subsequent
	character until it hits the ending tag.

	Developers use comments to communicate information to one another. They'll
	often use it to describe code. I'll be using it to explain the HTML below. 

	Unfortunately, I cannot copy the tag here because it breaks the comment, 
	but see the top and bottom of the document (<! >) part, to see how
	the starting and ending tags are defined.
	
	==========================================
	Basic Document Structure
	==========================================
	
	We write web pages with two languages: HTML and CSS.

	HTML describes the content and structure of a page. 
	CSS describes the layout and design of a page. We talk about this in 
	css/style.css 

	We keep HTML and CSS separate, so that we can easily exchange a new design
	for a piece of content, or a new piece of content for a design. 

	Each HTML document has the following structure:

	<html>
		<head>
		</head>
		<body>
		</body>
	</html>

	Everything in between <head> and </head> is used to describe the document.
	No text in between this tag is actually shown on the main screen. You can
	use special, "head-friendly" tags to describe things like the pages title,
	reference other resources, etc.

	Everything in the body tag is shown on the screen.

	==========================================
	Indentation
	==========================================

	Throughout this document, you'll notice I use a strict indentation scheme.
	When I have a new element, I'll often put it on a separate line and indent it.
	You'll learn that you can have elements within elements. To prevent being
	confused or lost when navigating your code, indentation helps create structure. 

	Browsers don't care about indentation, but other programmers, including myself,
	do. 

	==========================================
	Elements and Tags
	==========================================

	HTML documents are defined by a series of elements. You identify an 
	HTML element if it's a piece of text surrounded by a < and >. This part
	of an HTML element is called a tag. Tags are a special part of the HTML
	document that are used to describe a piece of text.

	For example:

	<h1>Hello world</h1>

	The above is an HTML element. We can tell because it's surrounded by
	two tags <h1> and </h1>. This element is a Header element and it consists
	of an opening and closing tag (the / is part of the closing tag). The text
	in between the tags is just a generic piece of text. What the browser will
	do is it will take that text and turn it into a bold, large font, which is
	what HTML defines to be a Header.

<html>
	<head>

			==========================================
			Titles
			==========================================

			Here is one special head-friendly element that will describe the page's
			title. Browsers will use the text between the title elements as the
			text on the "tab", and other places. 
		-->
		<title>Artur's Page</title>
		<style>
			img {
				width: 100px;
			}
		</style>
	</head>
	<body>
		<!--
				==========================================
				Headers and Paragraphs
				==========================================

				Header <h#> and Paragraph tags <p> describe ordinary text as content for the
				browser. Paragraph tags are basic pieces of text, whereas headers may describe
				titles.

				Headers have a special, and almost arbitrary, nature. There are 6 defined header
				tags in HTML. They are: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. Each subsequent tag is, by
				default, defined to be smaller than the preceding one. The idea is that the HTML
				authors believed that, broadly, that most documents don't go more than 6
				titles deep.

				==========================================
				Images
				==========================================
	
				Images are an interesting tag because they don't necessarily describe text. 
				Instead, the browser uses the image tag to actually put an image file where
				the tag is defined. How does that work? With Attributes
				
				==========================================
				Attributes
				========================================== 

				Remember, we define tags by putting a piece of text between < and > (and </ and >
				for closing tags). However, in addition to the name of the tag, you can also
				put additional pieces of text, separated by a space. This additional text is
				called an attribute. They refer to "features" of a tag. 

				For images, this feature is the "source" of an image, and the name of the attribute
				is called src. Each attribute has an attribute name and attribute value. The
				structure of an attribute is like so:

					attribute_name="attribute_value"
				
				==========================================
				Using Files for Images
				==========================================
				
				The src attribute is used to indicate to the browser where the file is
				located on my computer. Here, I use a relative path.

				What does relative means? It means I'm telling the browser this is where my
				file is located, relative to the location of this file (the HTML file). 
				Thus, the browser will first use the location of this file, and then use
				the value for the src file to find the Image file. 

				I then write css/ to tell the browser that there is a img/ folder in the same 
				folder as this HTML file, and in that there is a me.png file.
				
				==========================================
				Using Links for Images
				==========================================

				Instead of files, you can also use a link as the value for this tag. Thus, for 
				the src attribute, you can literally write:

				http://samaghon.com/z2h/me.png

				And you will render the same image. You can't just substitute any link to the
				src attribute. It must be a link directly to the image. You can test this in
				two ways:

				1. You can see if it has a common image extension (.jpg, .jpeg, .png)
				2. You can see if, when you load the link your browser, it only loads the image
				
				==========================================
				Self-Closing Tags
				==========================================

				One thing you might notice is that the image element does't have a partner </img>
				tag at the end. You can just interpret that this is the way it is and move on.

				Still, this does make some logical sense. Tags wrapped around arbitrary text
				content are used to describe what that content is and how it should look on the
				screen. Images don't describe anything. Instead, they replace the tag with the file. 
				So there's no need to add any additional text between two tags.

		<img src="img/me.png">

			==========================================
			Lorem Ipsum - Generic Text
			==========================================
			Sometimes, you might be focused on just making the design of your website, without
			having the text ready. In order to see how that text would look like, you need some
			filler text that can aesthetically simulate what real text would look like.

			That's where "Lorem ipsum" comes in. Lorem ipsum is a generic, non-sensical language
			that can be algorithmically generated. You can then copy it in as a placeholder.

			Below is a website to generate generic text. I used it to generate the text in the p tag

			Generic text generated by www.lipsum.com

				==========================================
				Anchors (Links)
				==========================================

				Anchor tags allow us to place links on the page. We use the href attribute to provide a
				valid link that the browser will go to when the text is clicked.

				The anchor tag is coupled with some default presentation rules (the link is underlined,
				and is in blue). We'll learn how to edit this later.

				Lastly, you can place different types of values for the href tag besides links. You
				can link directly to files (as you would with the img tag). For example, if I had
				a separate HTML file in the same folder as this HTML file, the link below would
				make the browser open this separate webpage:

					<a href="other_file.html">Go to my other page!</a>

				You should try this on your own time. 
				
				==========================================
				Why are they inline?
				==========================================
				
				If you try to load this page in your browser, you'll notice these links show up
				on the same line. Other elements, like paragraphs, are placed on a new line. 

				Why is this? By default, HTML has specific rules on how certain elements should
				show up on the screen.

				Paragraph tags (and header tags, and images, etc.) are called "block" elements, 
				and this means that they are supposed to take up the full width of whatever
				element they are a part of.

				Anchor tags (and form elements, etc.) are called "inline" elements, and this
				means they try to stay on the same line as long as their parent element
				provides them with enough space. If you have too many inline elements on the
				same line, then they go to the next one. 

				Try putting a bunch of links together, and then resizing the browser with your mouse.
				You'll see the links move to fit the width of the parent element (in this case, 
				the page). 

				==========================================
				Links without a destination: #
				==========================================

				Again, when you are designing, you might not have all of your content ready to
				go yet. To put a placeholder link, you can put a # character for the value
				of the href attribute. The link will still show, but when you click on it, it 
				won't go anywhere.

				The # character has a more specific purpose that we'll study when we look
				in the with_css.html file.

				==========================================
				Lists
				==========================================

				The next set of elements we'll learn about refers to creating lists on a
				page. Maybe you have a recipe, or set of bullets that you want to display
				on a page. HTML provides a number of tools to make it happen. 

				You start by defining a sectin of a set of list items with either the
				ul or ol tag. UL stands for Unordered List and OL stands for Ordered List.
				Within either of these elements, you can then define a set of list item
				elements using the li tag. Below is a simple example of a bulleted list:

				<ul>
					<li>Bullet 1</li>
					<li>Bullet 2</li>
				</ul>

				There is something really interesting though that, we've done before,
				but haven't really thought about. That is, rather than putting text
				between tags, we're putting other elements. HTML tags will try to
				describe any content that's between the tags.

				So below, I extend the above example further. I put a link within
				each bullet, and I try to "link" an image and a piece of text.

				If you load the page, you'll see that when you hover of the image
				or the text, it becomes clickable!
			-->
		<ul>
			<!-- this creates the bullet -->
			<li>
				<!-- here we create the link -->
				<a href="http://hackwestern.com/">
					<!-- both of these items are now linked to hackwestern.com! -->
					<img src="img/logo.png" />

			Tables
			==========================================

			Another tool that HTML provides you with out of the box is the ability
			to add tables to your web page. Tables borrow the similar pattern of
			embedding elements within elements to construct the final result.

			One major caveat is that, because HTML follows a line-by-line, indentation
			style, you can't layout your table in a natural row by column format.

			See below for a line by line walkthrough:
		-->
		<!-- this defines the table, if you just had this, we wouldn't see anything -->
		<table>
			<!-- a table has 3 major parts
				head: the names of each column
				body: individual rows of data
				foot: the last row
			-->
			<thead>
				<!-- each section consists of rows, which we define with tr, a table row -->
				<tr>
					<!-- each row consists of table data: td. Each td item represents a column.
					Be very careful with this! you must have a consistent number of columns
					in each row. If you want a single table data item to take up more than
					one column of space, you use the colspan attribute, i.e.

						<td colspan="2">A data item that takes up 2 columns</td>

					Takes up "2 columns" of space. 
					-->
					<td>Event Name</td>
					<td>Location</td>
					<td>Date</td>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<!-- now we define the body. The body elements means that these rows will
			always be between the rows in thead, and tfoot -->
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<!-- note how the number of td items matches up with the td items before! -->
					<td>Zero to Hero</td>
					<td>Western University</td>
					<td>March 5, 2015</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>

				Forms
				==========================================

				Forms are going to be a very interesting HTML element that we're really only
				going to "get" in Week 2. The basic gist is that forms allow us to take
				information from the user, and bring it to "us". We can use that information
				to manipulate the website, add new sections, etc.

				A simple example are Tweets. Twitter has a form for you to input a tweet. When
				you submit the tweet, that data goes to Twitter, and then Twitter uses it to
				added it to the Twitter timeline when you load the page again.

				We'll learn how to do the latter part of that process later, but for now, we want
				to know how to lay out and get information from the user. That's done through forms.

				Each form has a set of two elements: a label and an input. There are MANY
				types of form elements that you can look at here:

				https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms
			-->
		<form>
			<label>Your Email:</label>
			<input type="text" />
			<label>Your Subject:</label>
			<input type="text" />
			<label>Content:</label>
			<!-- this is a larger text input -->
			<textarea></textarea>
