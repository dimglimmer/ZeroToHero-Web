	==========================================
	Adding a design to our page with CSS
	==========================================

	Recall: CSS describes the layout and design of a page. We keep the HTML and CSS
	separate so we can easily substitute one of them, and preserve the other. It makes
	it really easy to substitute the design of a page and keep the content the same. 

	This annotation is split into two parts. The bulk of it is in the css file located:
		css/style.css 
-->
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Artur's Page</title>
		<!--
			==========================================
			Linking stylesheets
			==========================================

			Remember, HTML and CSS code should be separated so that, as it gets bigger,
			it doesn't make your code too hard too navigate.

			Here, I use the link tag to reference a .CSS file, which has all of the code
			describing the design of this page. This is how we can add CSS to an HTML page.

			We reference our CSS file just like we referenced our image file before. Again, it's
			done relatively, and we tell the browser there is an css/ folder in the same
			folder as this HTML file, and that there is a style.css file inside. 

			type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" are additional attributes that you
			must add to every link file.

		<link href="css/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
	</head>
	<body>

			==========================================
			Divs - Abstract Sections on the Page
			==========================================
			
			To really "get" how powerful CSS is, we need to introduce a new set of HTML elements
			to our toolbox, which are elements that don't have any immediate visual effect. 

			Divs are on such elements. Divs are an abstract section. They are a block element,
			which means that when you use them, they will take up the full width of the page.

			We use divs to create a structure around our page. We then use a special attribute
			to give the div element a name that we can use to apply design and layout rules.

			In this case, we use a class.

			==========================================
			Class attribute
			==========================================

			There are two types of attributes you can use in order to give an HTML element,
			and that means any HTML elements (not just a div), a special name so that you
			can apply styling rules only to THAT element.

			Classes are used when you want to have a name that you can use across multiple elements.
			For example, let's say I want to set the text for a particular set of elements to be red,
			I would use the class attribute like so:

				<h1 class="red-text">Hey!</h1>
				<p class="red-text">This will be red</p>

			Both elements will have a rule applied to it to make the text red. I can keep
			reusing the class however many times I want.

			Another attribute is called Id, which can only be used once on an HTML page. See below.
		-->
		<!-- here I apply a class to position this set of elements to be on the left side of the page -->
		<div class="push-left">
			<!--
				==========================================
				Id attribute
				==========================================

				The Id element works exactly the same way as the class, except that you can only
				have Ids with a particular value *one* time. Ids are unique and cannot be reused on the same page. 

				You can have multiple id attributes, but each must have a unique value.

				You can learn how to access and define rules for Classes and Ids in the style.css file!
