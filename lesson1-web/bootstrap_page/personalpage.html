			Bootstrap and Adding Bootstrap
			==========================================

			What is Bootstrap?

			Bootstrap is a CSS framework. A framework is a set of pre-written code that implements common patterns
			or functionality that others can use to build their websites. Bootstrap is a set of CSS rules that you
			can use in your web page to implement a variety of features.

			Bootstrap will override a lot of defaults that the web browser uses. It also includes a number of
			additional components that you commonly see on other websites.

			Visit http://getbootstrap.com/ to learn more.

			Adding bootstrap involves adding a number of things to your HEAD element, and to the bottom of BODY

			Below I annotate what key lines you need, they are prepended with NEEDED FOR BOOTSTRAP
		-->

			==========================================
			Custom Themes from Bootswatch
			==========================================

			Bootstrap comes with an out of the box set of colours, fonts, and styles. Of course, if everyone
			uses bootstrap, a lot of websites look very similar. Below, I add a theme on top of my bootstrap,
			which overrides parts of Boostrap to give it a relatively more unique look.

			You can look for themes at http://bootswatch.com/

			To add a theme, either get the link for the CSS file and link it below OR download and save the file 
			in your CSS folder, and link it.

			Make sure to link it BELOW or AFTER you link your bootstrap css files.

			Icons from FontAwesome
			==========================================

			Font Awesome is an awesome (pun intended) CSS library/framework for adding icons to your website.
			With Font Awesome, you can add icons with CSS classes.

			You should visit http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/ to learn more.
			
			For a list of icons, visit: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/

		<!--
			==========================================
			Simple Styles in the HTML
			==========================================

			Because I want to make quick edits that override bootstrap, I added a style tag to the HTML document.
			Since these were small edits and this document wasn't going to get much more complicated, I can
			get away with this.

			However, when you build your website, avoid this and put your CSS in a separate file.
		-->
		<style>
			body {
				padding-top: 60px;
			}

			.tab-pane {
				padding: 20px;
			}

			.section {
				margin-bottom: 30px;
			}

			.bg-white {
				background-color: white;
			}

			.fa {
				margin-right: 10px;
			}
		</style>
	</head>
	<body>
		<!--
			==========================================
			Container
			==========================================

			The container class is a helper class from Bootstrap that takes up a specific width
			of the page and then centers the section. It's a really good way to layout your content
			so that it appears in a structured and centered way.

			Often, I will all start off my website by adding a container so that items don't hug
			the side of the browser window.

			See: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#overview-container
		-->
		<div class="container">

				==========================================
				The Grid System
				==========================================
				
				This is the single most powerful feature of Bootstrap. The Grid system takes away the
				complication of dealing with the position of elements. Instead of creating your own
				custom divs and setting the width of each column with %s, we can use the structured
				grid that Bootstrap provides.

				Bootstrap provides a number of classes we can use to construct a grid. Whenever we
				want to define a layout with columns, we first start by creating a row. Within that row, 
				we define a set of divs as columns. The individual widths of the columns must sum up
				to 12 for that row.

				Below are a few examples:

				This is a grid of 50% width for each column, with 2 columns
				
				|									 | 								 |
				|									 | 								 |
				|									 | 								 |
				|									 | 								 |	
				|======== 6 =======|======= 6 =======| -> adds up to 12
				|									 | 								 |
				|									 | 								 |
				|									 | 								 |
				|									 | 								 |

				HTML would be:

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-6">
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
					</div>
				</div>

				This is 25%, 75% grid, with 2 columns

				|					|  			  								 |
				|					|				  								 |
				|					|				  								 |
				|					|				  								 |	
				|=== 3 ===|=========== 9 ============| -> adds up to 12
				|					|				  								 |
				|					|				  								 |
				|					|				  								 |
				|					|				  								 |
				
				HTML: 

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-3">
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-9">
					</div>
				</div>

				And this is 33%, 33%, 33% grid, with 3 columns.

				|					   | 		  		 | 	 				 |
				|					   | 		  		 | 	 				 |
				|					   | 		  		 | 	 				 |
				|					   | 		  		 | 	 				 |	
				|===== 4 ====|==== 4 ====|==== 4 ====| -> adds up to 12
				|					   | 		  		 | 	 				 |
				|					   | 		  		 | 	 				 |
				|					   | 		  		 | 	 				 |
				|					   | 		  		 | 	 				 |

				HTML:

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-4">
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-4">
					</div>
				</div>

				Below I use the grid system twice to define a few layouts. 

				See: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid

				==========================================
				Grids for Multiple Screen Sizes
				==========================================
				
				Another huge problem that Bootstrap solves is using grids for different screen sizes. So
				think that you can use the grid system to define a different layout for laptops, tablets,
				and mobile phones.

				You use this by changing the characters between col- and -#. Your options include: xs,
				sm, md, lg. 

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-3 col-xs-6">
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-9 col-xs-6">
					</div>
				</div>

				On a tablet or larger screen size, the column widths will be 25% and 75% wide, respectively.
				On a phone, the column widths will be 50% and 50% wide, respectively.

				There is more to this, so we'll try to explore it if we have time.

						Organizing Your Pages with Divs
						==========================================

						We learned in the last lesson that divs can be used to apply CSS rules to.
						I also like to use divs to organize my pages. In this case, I added a class
						called section. I also added a simple rule (see at the top) to space
						out each section.

								Tabs
								==========================================

								As mentioned before, Bootstrap comes with a lot of extra components out of the box for you to work with.

								These components are documented in two sections of the Bootstrap website: 
								
								http://getbootstrap.com/components/
								http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/

								If you include all of the files that have the NEEDED FOR BOOTSTRAP comment before them, in
								the same sections as I did here, then copying and pasting the HTML from each site should work.

								These components are constructed from the same basic building blocks as all of the HTML we've learned 
								so far. The point is not to be intimidated by the code written, and take the time to break down
								and understand, to the best that you can, what you are copying down.

								Let's go line by line.

								See: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tabs
							-->

						<!-- this contains everything to do with the tabs -->
						<div role="tabpanel">
							<!-- the tab panel is split into two parts, the tabs we click on, and the content they display when clicked -->
						  <!-- Nav tabs -->

						  <!-- unsurprisingly, this is just a list of items. the class nav nav-tabs affects their design and capabilities -->
						  <ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
						  	<!-- when copying this over, we want to make sure we edit two things
						  		href -> which affects which tab content is displayed. The #hw corresponds to id="hw" below.
						  		aria-controls -> same as href but no # to keep it consistent
						  		the text between the anchor tags, which affects what's displayed to the user
						  		-->
						    <li role="presentation" class="active"><a href="#hw" aria-controls="hw" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">Hack Western</a></li>
						    <li role="presentation"><a href="#guten" aria-controls="guten" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">Guten Code</a></li>
						    <li role="presentation"><a href="#pbsn" aria-controls="pbsn" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">PBSN</a></li>

										==========================================
										Grid within a grid
										==========================================

										Within the tab-pane, I actually define a new row and grid. The idea is that the tab-pane is
										almost like a mini-web page of its own, and I can use a complex layout.

										Grids can be within other grids. If a row is within another column, then 100% of its space
										is actually the width of its parent column.

										In this case, this tab is only as wide as the width of its parent column: 8 or 66%. 

										That means that this new grid's maximum width is 100%. When we do a new row with 2 columns, which
										are 33% and 66% wide, they take up 1/3 and 2/3 of the 66% space available to us.

								Forms in Bootstrap
								==========================================
								
								Bootstrap adds a lot of functionality for creating really good forms, as they are essentially
								for receiving user input.

								The form-group class allows us to wrap our label-input pairs into an element that each of these
								on individual lines, among other things.

								The form-control class will style the inputs to look more aesthetically pleasant and functional.

								The placeholder attribute adds some placeholder text within the text box.

								Most importantly, we have the for attribute in the label element, and the id attribute
								in the input/textarea elements that match up. This doesn't have any immediate relevance for us now,
								but it's important for when we receive data from the user next week, as this name is used
								to get the data. 

								See: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms
							-->
						<form>
							<div class="form-group">
								<label for="emailSender">Your Email:</label>
								<input type="email" class="form-control" id="emailSender" placeholder="Enter email" />
