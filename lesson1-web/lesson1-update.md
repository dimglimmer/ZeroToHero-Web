# Lesson 1 Update

Hey everyone,

This is a follow up e-mail to the first Guten Code lesson, which took place on Thursday, March 5, 2015. We learned how to code in HTML and CSS for the first time, and were introduced to a powerful new framework called Bootstrap which will help us get started in building modern pages quickly.

## Class Files

I've added three folders to this website which you can browse and download to catch up on the class material. Each folder has files which are completely annotated, describing the lines of code written, and has additional links for follow up resources.

* `basic_page`: is the page we built to introduce us to HTML and CSS. Three files are relevant here: `no_css.html`, `with_css.html` and `css/style.css`. 
* `bootstrap_page`: is the page we built to introduce us to Bootstrap. I discuss in length how the Grid system works, how to implement the Tab control, and how to add a custom theme and icons. The file you want is `personalpage.html`. 
* `starter_template`: if you want to start building your own pages, start here. I made a blank html file which includes Bootstrap which you can start working with without issues. 

## Next Steps

On Thursday, March 12 we're learning Ruby on Rails for the first time. *By next week, you need to have installed the following software:*

Heroku Toolbelt: https://toolbelt.heroku.com/

Ruby on Rails (Mac Tutorial): https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.9-mavericks
Ruby on Rails (Windows Tutorial): http://railsftw.bryanbibat.net/

For the Ruby on Rails links above, you need to go through each tutorial and install the required software or you will NOT be able to participate. Make sure to go through all of the required steps so that you can navigate to http://localhost and see a sample webpage. 

## Contest
** This is for Western students only **

For those who really want to take the time and apply what we've learned, I've got a contest. Create your own personal web page with what we've learned and post it on our Facebook group. The post with the most likes (you can ask your friends outside of the group to like it too) gets to win a new Google ChromeCast!

Note: you must use the concepts we've learned, so only HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. 

When making a submission, you can either upload a picture, or upload your site to http://neocities.org. 

To use neocities.org, follow the steps below:

1. Visit the website and register an account. You'll be automatically logged in.
2. Then move your mouse to the top right, to your username/sitename. A dropdown menu will appear and you will have the option to Edit site.
3. This takes you to a page where you can upload and delete files. Replace the default files neocities adds with all of the files and folders associated with your webpage.
4. See sitename.neocities.org for your page!
